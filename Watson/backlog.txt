Backlog of the community fact checker

As a fact checker, I must be able to
- Indicate investigating fact count in the present document
- Add a opposing fact of another document to an existing fact
- List all opposing fact of a fact
- Vote for a fact : good, bad, not a fact
- Vote for an opposing fact (greater, medium, low)
- Qualify document (scientific, politic, non professional blog) to estimate quality and pertinence
- Hide unimportant words in a fact, replaced by [...]

Technical :
- Update hightlight style
- Check existing fact at same location in document (Xmap) to be sure there is no conflict
- Update highlight injection to not alter document structure display
- Can not create a fact on multiple dom element (p)
- Add domain id and not Guid.
